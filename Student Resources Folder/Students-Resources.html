                  <h4><span>What is a Credit Score?</span></h4>
                  <p>A credit score is a three-digit number, typically between 300 and 850, designed to represent your credit risk, or the likelihood you will pay your bills on time.</p>
                  <p>Here is a general look at credit score ranges:</p><br>
                  <div class="li-properties">
                      <ul>
                          <li>300-579: Poor</li>
                          <li>580-669: Fair</li>
                          <li>670-739: Good</li>
                          <li>740-799: Very good</li>
                          <li>800-850: Excellent</li>
                      </ul> 
                  </div>
                  <h4><span>Why are credit scores important?</span></h4>
                  <p>It’s important because it allows lenders to determine if you can handle your money correctly and if they should risk lending you money. Credit scores will enable you to do many like applying for a loan, car, house, etc.</p>

                <h4><span>What is an Emergency Fund?</span></h4>
                <p>An emergency fund is a bank account with money set aside to pay for significant, unexpected expenses, such as:</p><br>
                <div class="li-properties">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unforeseen medical expenses</li>
                        <li>Home-appliance repair or replacement</li>
                        <li>Major car fixes</li>
                        <li>Unemployment</li>
                    </ul> 
                </div>
                <h4><span>How much should I save?</span></h4>
                <p><strong>The short answer:</strong> If starting small, try to set aside at least $500, but work your way up to half a year’s worth of expenses.</p>
                <p><strong>The long answer:</strong> The right amount for you depends on your financial circumstances, but a good rule of thumb is to have enough to cover three to six months’ worth of living expenses. (You might need more if you freelance or work seasonally, for example, or if your job would be hard to replace.) Then, if you lose your job, you could use the money to pay for necessities while you find a new one or the funds could supplement your unemployment benefits. So start small, Weston says, but start.</p>
                <p>Having even $500 saved can get you out of many financial scrapes. So put something away now, and build your fund over time.</p>
                <h4><span>Why Is An Emergency Fund Important?</span></h4>
                <p>Emergency funds create a financial buffer that can keep you afloat in a time of need without having to rely on credit cards or high-interest loans. It can be essential to have an emergency fund if you have debt because it can help you avoid borrowing more.</p>

                  <h4><span>Join the Military as an Enlisted Member</span></h4>
                  <p>Enlisted members make up most of the military workforce. They receive training in a job specialty and do most of the hands-on work. Usually, you’ll sign up for four years of active duty and four years inactive. After you’ve completed your active duty time, you can either extend your contract or re-enlist if you want to continue serving.</p>
                  <p>Officers make up a much smaller part of the workforce. To join as an officer, you typically must have a four-year college degree and complete an officer program. You compete for promotion to continue your career. Most officers are managers who plan and direct operations. Others are professionals like doctors and lawyers. Officers get paid more than enlisted members and enjoy certain other benefits.</p>
                  <p>You don’t have to join as an officer to become one though. You can join as an enlisted member and attend officer training later on.</p>
                  <h4><span>Age Limits for Enlisting</span></h4>
                  <p>You must be at least 17 to enlist in any branch of the active military. The oldest you can be to enlist for active duty in each branch is:</p><br>
                  <div class="li-properties">
                      <ul>
                          <li>Army: 34</li>
                          <li>Navy: 39</li>
                          <li>Air Force: 39 </li>
                          <li>Coast Guard: 31</li>
                          <li>Marines: 28</li>
                          <li>Space Force: 39</li>
                      </ul> 
                  </div>
                  <p>Some branches have different age limits for their part-time Reserve and National Guard. Visit each service's recruiting website for its part-time age limits.</p>
                  <h4><span>Steps for Joining the Military</span></h4>
                  <p>Start by doing some research about your options for joining the military. Learn about the five active-duty branches and their part-time counterparts. Know the main differences between officers and enlisted members.</p>
                  <p>Once you know which branch you’re considering, contact a recruiter. A recruiter will give you an overview and answer your questions about that service. If you’re interested in more than one branch, contact a recruiter for each. If you’re interested in joining as an officer, the recruiter will explain any options you may be eligible for.</p>
                  <p>If you decide to enlist, you will report to a military entrance processing station (MEPS). You’ll spend a day or two completing pre-enlistment steps. These include taking the ASVAB, having a physical exam, meeting with a career counselor, and if you’re accepted,taking the oath of enlistment. From there you’ll receive orders for basic training, usually to start within a few weeks. If you enrolled in a delayed entry program, you’ll go home and get orders for basic training within a year.</p>
