                  <h4><span>What is a Credit Score?</span></h4>
                  <p>A credit score is a three-digit number, typically between 300 and 850, designed to represent your credit risk, or the likelihood you will pay your bills on time.</p>
                  <p>Here is a general look at credit score ranges:</p><br>
                  <div class="li-properties">
                      <ul>
                          <li>300-579: Poor</li>
                          <li>580-669: Fair</li>
                          <li>670-739: Good</li>
                          <li>740-799: Very good</li>
                          <li>800-850: Excellent</li>
                      </ul> 
                  </div>
                  <h4><span>Why are credit scores important?</span></h4>
                  <p>It’s important because it allows lenders to determine if you can handle your money correctly and if they should risk lending you money. Credit scores will enable you to do many like applying for a loan, car, house, etc.</p>

                <h4><span>What is an Emergency Fund?</span></h4>
                <p>An emergency fund is a bank account with money set aside to pay for significant, unexpected expenses, such as:</p><br>
                <div class="li-properties">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unforeseen medical expenses</li>
                        <li>Home-appliance repair or replacement</li>
                        <li>Major car fixes</li>
                        <li>Unemployment</li>
                    </ul> 
                </div>
                <h4><span>How much should I save?</span></h4>
                <p><strong>The short answer:</strong> If starting small, try to set aside at least $500, but work your way up to half a year’s worth of expenses.</p>
                <p><strong>The long answer:</strong> The right amount for you depends on your financial circumstances, but a good rule of thumb is to have enough to cover three to six months’ worth of living expenses. (You might need more if you freelance or work seasonally, for example, or if your job would be hard to replace.) Then, if you lose your job, you could use the money to pay for necessities while you find a new one or the funds could supplement your unemployment benefits. So start small, Weston says, but start.</p>
                <p>Having even $500 saved can get you out of many financial scrapes. So put something away now, and build your fund over time.</p>
                <h4><span>Why Is An Emergency Fund Important?</span></h4>
                <p>Emergency funds create a financial buffer that can keep you afloat in a time of need without having to rely on credit cards or high-interest loans. It can be essential to have an emergency fund if you have debt because it can help you avoid borrowing more.</p>

The reserve components are Army Reserve and Army National Guard.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.navy.mil/"><strong>The Navy</strong></a> is part of the DOD. It protects waterways (sea and ocean) outside of the Coast Guard’s jurisdiction. Navy warships provide the runways for aircraft to land and take off when at sea. Navy SEALs (sea, air, and land) are the special operations force for this branch. All service members are known as sailors. The reserve component is Navy Reserve.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.af.mil/"><strong>The Air Force</strong></a> is part of the Department of Defense (DOD). It’s responsible for aerial military operations, defending U.S. air bases, and building landing strips. Service members are known as airmen. The reserve components are Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.uscg.mil/"><strong>The Coast Guard</strong></a> is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

                  <h4><span>Join the Military as an Enlisted Member</span></h4>
                  <p>Enlisted members make up most of the military workforce. They receive training in a job specialty and do most of the hands-on work. Usually, you’ll sign up for four years of active duty and four years inactive. After you’ve completed your active duty time, you can either extend your contract or re-enlist if you want to continue serving.</p>
                  <p>Officers make up a much smaller part of the workforce. To join as an officer, you typically must have a four-year college degree and complete an officer program. You compete for promotion to continue your career. Most officers are managers who plan and direct operations. Others are professionals like doctors and lawyers. Officers get paid more than enlisted members and enjoy certain other benefits.</p>
                  <p>You don’t have to join as an officer to become one though. You can join as an enlisted member and attend officer training later on.</p>
                  <h4><span>Age Limits for Enlisting</span></h4>
                  <p>You must be at least 17 to enlist in any branch of the active military. The oldest you can be to enlist for active duty in each branch is:</p><br>

                  </div>
                  <p>Some branches have different age limits for their part-time Reserve and National Guard. Visit each service's recruiting website for its part-time age limits.</p>

                  <p>Start by doing some research about your options for joining the military. Learn about the five active-duty branches and their part-time counterparts. Know the main differences between officers and enlisted members.</p>
                  <p>Once you know which branch you’re considering, contact a recruiter. A recruiter will give you an overview and answer your questions about that service. If you’re interested in more than one branch, contact a recruiter for each. If you’re interested in joining as an officer, the recruiter will explain any options you may be eligible for.</p>
                  <p>If you decide to enlist, you will report to a military entrance processing station (MEPS). You’ll spend a day or two completing pre-enlistment steps. These include taking the ASVAB, having a physical exam, meeting with a career counselor, and if you’re accepted,taking the oath of enlistment. From there you’ll receive orders for basic training, usually to start within a few weeks. If you enrolled in a delayed entry program, you’ll go home and get orders for basic training within a year.</p>

                  <p>At a point in your life, you wanted to buy something. Maybe it's a phone, games, clothes, or even want to spend money going out and eating food. All of those items and food cost money. The world revolves around money. The best way to earn money is to work for it and get a job.</p>
                  <h4><span>Why is having a job important?</span></h4>
                  <p>Even if you didn't have anything you wanted to buy, having money is always great and having a job helps you achieve that. Having a job can help you with other things too. Like it can boost your self-esteem and confidence by giving you purpose, and it's much easier to be happy when you feel your worth.</p>
                  <h4><span>How do you get a job?</span></h4>
                  <p>The best way to find a job is by looking around online. We are in the technology age, and with a simple google search, you can find an available position in your area.</p>

                  <h4><span>What is a Resume?</span></h4>
                  <p>The term resume comes from the French and means a "summary." So that's what your resume is: A summary of your qualifications, skills, and achievements. It shows a future employer what you have done in the past. It details your skills and training, work experience, education, and, most importantly, the accomplishments you have made with past employers.</p>
                  <p>It should also inform the employer of your career objective (the job you are seeking) and communicate concisely the benefits you will bring to the job if hired.</p>
                  <p>A resume is an advertisement. It advertises you, your unique skills and qualifications, and stresses the benefits you have to offer.</p>
                  <h4><span>Why is having a Resume important?</span></h4>
                  <p>The resume has become the number one requirement potential employers request. Before an employer takes valuable time to interview you, he or she wants to meet you – on paper. How you impress that employer with your resume can, and will, make all the difference.</p>
                  <p>Without a resume, you can't even begin to compete, and an inferior overview will quickly eliminate you before you even have a fighting chance. That is why it is imperative to have a superior resume, one that effectively lets employers know what you can do for them.</p>
                  <h4><span>Where do I make a Resume?</span></h4>
                  <P>On the internet, there are lots of websites dedicated to helping you make a resume.</P>

                <h4><span>What is healthy living?</span></h4>
                <p>Healthy living to most people means both physical and mental health are in balance or functioning well together in a person. In many instances, physical and mental health are closely linked, so that a change (good or bad) in one directly affects the other. Consequently, some of the tips will include suggestions for emotional and mental healthy living.</p>
                <h4><span>Does a healthy lifestyle make a difference?</span></h4>
                <p>As it turns out, healthy habits make a big difference. According to this analysis, people who met criteria for all five habits enjoyed significantly, impressively longer lives than those who had none: 14 years for women and 12 years for men (if they had these habits at age 50). People who had none of these habits were far more likely to die prematurely from cancer or cardiovascular disease.</p>
                <p>Study investigators also calculated life expectancy by how many of these five healthy habits people had. Just one healthy habit (and it didn’t matter which one) … just one… extended life expectancy by two years in men and women. Not surprisingly, the more healthy habits people had, the longer their lifespan. This is one of those situations where I wish I could reprint their graphs for you, because they’re so cool. (But if you’re very curious, the article is available online, and the graphs are on page 7. Check out Graph B, “Estimated life expectancy at age 50 according to the number of low-risk factors.”)</p>
                <p>This is huge. And, it confirms prior similar research — a lot of prior similar research. A 2017 study using data from the Health and Retirement Study found that people 50 and older who were normal weight, had never smoked, and drank alcohol in moderation lived on average seven years longer. A 2012 mega-analysis of 15 international studies that included over 500,000 participants found that over half of premature deaths were due to unhealthy lifestyle factors such as poor diet, inactivity, obesity, excessive alcohol intake, and smoking. And the list of supporting research goes on.</p>

                <h4><span>Scholarships</span></h4>
                <p>Scholarships provide an opportunity for people to earn an education. Without assistance from an outside source, students may have trouble paying for the degree.</p>
                <p>Scholarships help students have more time to focus on their studies.  Research shows that work can take up more than 15 hours per week and becomes an obstacle to academic success. For many students, the stresses of working make it difficult for them to graduate on time, or graduate with the high grades they have the potential to achieve. For other students, the work/study life is unsustainable, and they discontinue their studies altogether.</p>
                <p>Scholarships can fill the gap.  Scholarship assistance can support students who fall in the gap between high and low-income levels — students who may not qualify for a need-based scholarship and who do not meet the criteria for a merit-based scholarship. Scholarships also decrease the number and amount of loans students need to take to complete college.</p>

                <h4><span>What Is the FAFSA?</span></h4>
                <p>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form you need to fill out to get any financial aid from the federal government to help pay for college. Each year, over 13 million students who file the FAFSA get more than $120 billion in grants, work-study, and low-interest loans from the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
                <h4><span>FAFSA Facts</span></h4><br>
                <div class="li-properties">
                  <ul>
                      <li>Submitting the FAFSA is the most important thing you can do if you want financial aid.</li>
                      <li>The FAFSA is free—you don’t need to pay anyone to prepare it for you.</li>
                      <li>You need to submit a new FAFSA before each academic year in which you want to get aid. If you plan to apply for aid throughout college, you’ll need to fill out the FAFSA each year.</li>
                      <li>Be sure to use a permanent email address on the form, not your high school email, so you can use your FAFSA account throughout college.</li>
                  </ul> 
                </div>
                <h4><span>Who Should Fill Out the FAFSA?</span></h4><br>
                <p>Anyone planning on going to college in the next academic year should fill out the FAFSA.</p>
                <h4><span>How to Fill Out the FAFSA?</span></h4><br>
                <div class="li-properties">

                      <li>By printing and filling out a FAFSA form, then mailing it to the address on the form.</li>
                  </ul> 
                </div>
                <p>We recommend filling out the FAFSA online or through the app. Both options offer useful tips to help you understand the questions, which can make it a lot easier to fill out and submit the application.</p>
                <p>When you fill out the FAFSA electronically, you’ll be asked to create a federal student aid ID (FSA ID). You’ll use it to sign the electronic form. Because one of your parents also has to sign off on your FAFSA, they’ll need to create an FSA ID, too.</p>
